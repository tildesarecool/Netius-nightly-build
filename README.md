# Netius-nightly-build
The latest and most bleeding edge version available.

Newtius is my horizontal "shmup" I'm writing using GameMaker Studio 2.3 (GMS2). 

This repo is to host the HTML5 version of the game genarated by GMS2. 

The actual game is playable at the address:

[https://tildesarecool.github.io/Netius-nightly-build/](https://tildesarecool.github.io/Netius-nightly-build/)

This is the absolute latest bleeding edge version though so it will likely be buggy and/or broken in multiple ways.

The source code of the game (GMS2 project etc) is at the [main newtius repository](https://github.com/tildesarecool/newtius). 

The repository for the "very first published version" I've saved for posterity for no particular reason [is at this separate repository](https://github.com/tildesarecool/newtius_pre-alpha-1-playable-800x600).

And the version I'm hoping will eventualy be considered the "stable" version I'm going to [leave over on the itch.io page for the game](https://tildesarecool.itch.io/newtius).

## Updates!

**26th January 2022**

As random speculative thing to try I tried the "clean" option under the "build menu" in GMS2 to see it that would fix it. I did a HTML5 preview and it was fixed. So then I generated the HTML5 zip file and put it in the repo and now it's fixed again. 

**25th January 2022**

No sooner had I posted this and uploaded the first "nightly build" but to find out the HTML5 version is completely broken. When I select Windows as the target is works perfectly well but even in the preview generated by GMS2 the HTML5 version for some reason took random parts of different images on different layers and made this weird mutant of a playable version. I have want to archive just for amusement. Well that's why it's "nightly", right?
