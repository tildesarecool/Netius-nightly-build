# Netius-nightly-build
The latest and most bleeding edge version available.

Newtius is my horizontal "shmup" I'm writing using GameMaker Studio 2.3 (GMS2). 

This repo is to host the HTML5 version of the game genarated by GMS2. 

The actual game is playable at the address:

[https://tildesarecool.github.io/Netius-nightly-build/](https://tildesarecool.github.io/Netius-nightly-build/)

This is the absolute latest bleeding edge version though so it will likely be buggy and/or broken in multiple ways.

The source code of the game (GMS2 project etc) is at the [main newtius repository](https://github.com/tildesarecool/newtius). 

The repository for the "very first published version" I've saved for posterity for no particular reason [is at this separate repository](https://github.com/tildesarecool/newtius_pre-alpha-1-playable-800x600).

And the version I'm hoping will eventualy be considered the "stable" version I'm going to [leave over on the itch.io page for the game](https://tildesarecool.itch.io/newtius).
